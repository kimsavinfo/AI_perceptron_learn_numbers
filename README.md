# AI_perceptron_learn_numbers

Perceptron with supervised learning.
The main goal is to learn the numbers then recognised them.
Please refer to doc_tech.pdf to get more details.

### What are the key words for this project ?
- MLP (Multiple Layer Perceptron)
- sigmoïde : 1 / ( 1 + exp^(-x) )
- feed-forward
- backpropagation : P = P + t * (A – O) * E
- overfitting
- refinement + planing
- unit tests

### MLP Numbers : do you want to play with it ?
